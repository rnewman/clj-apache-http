(defn #^ClientConnectionManager init-connection-manager
  "Creates an instance of ClientConnectionManager using the specified

   The opts param is a map with the following keys:

   :keystore-file [optional] Path to Java keystore containing any
   private keys and trusted certificate authority certificates required
   for this connection.

   :keystore-password [optional] Password to unlock KeyStore.

   :certificate-alias [optional] A name by which to access an X509
   certificate that will be loaded into the KeyStore.

   :certificate-file [optional] The path to the file containing an
   X509 certificate (or certificate chain) to be used in the https
   connection

   :hostname-verifier [optional] An implementation of
   org.apache.http.conn.ssl.X509HostnameVerifier for verifying the hostname
   of the remote server during the SSL handshake. If you omit this option,
   the connection will use an AllowAllHostnameVerifier, which does not
   actually verify the host. It just blindly accepts that the host is who
   it says it is. This is convenient, but not safe.

   :port [optional] The port number to connect to on the remote host. If
   this is not specified, defaults to 443.

   :trust-managers [optional] An array of javax.net.ssl.X509TrustManager.
   These are used to verify the certificates sent by the remote host. If
   you don't specify this option, the connection will use an instance of
   NaiveTrustManager, which blindly trusts all certificates. Again, this
   is handy, but it's not safe.

   :connection-mgr-type [optional] The type of connection manager you want
   to use. Valid values are 'SingleClientConnManager' and
   'ThreadSafeClientConnManager' (which is the default).

   Although none of these options are required, the realistic minimum
   required options for a secure connection using client-side certificates
   would be :keystore-file and :keystore-password (for your private key)
   and :certificate-file (and :certificate-password if your client cert
   is password-protected) to load the X509 client certificate."
